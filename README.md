## 🛠️ Working Principle
The **MQ-2 sensor** detects smoke and LPG gas.  
The **temperature sensor** monitors ambient heat.  
When dangerous levels are detected, the **NodeMCU** triggers:
- Buzzer alarm
- Blynk IoT notification alert on phone

---

## 📱 Blynk IoT Setup
- Create a new template
- Add Virtual Pins for sensor readings
- Add notification widget
- Enter authentication token into the code
